## Power BI – Superstore Sales Analysis

This project is created using the Superstore dataset to analyze sales and profit trends and to understand business performance using Power BI.  
I have also added a short-term sales forecast to see future trends based on historical data.

### What this dashboard shows
- Overall sales, profit, orders, and shipping performance
- Region-wise analysis using slicers (Central, East, South, West)
- Sales and profit distribution across different states
- Monthly sales and profit comparison across years
- Category and sub-category level performance
- 15-day sales forecast using Power BI forecasting feature

### Tools used
- Power BI  
- DAX  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Time-based analysis and forecasting  

### Key observations
- West region generates the highest sales.
- Technology and Office Supplies are the top-performing categories.
- Sales and profit generally increase towards the end of the year.
- The 15-day forecast shows steady sales performance in the short term.
